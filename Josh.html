        Hi Josh! Merry late Christmas and Happy 2025! I hope you have had a blast of a year last year. Sorry I wasn’t able to text much the 2nd half of last year but we are here now which is all that matters! Congratulations on surviving the first semester of college! Although I don't remember seeing you at Cornell, which was strange since you told me you’ll be there. Anyways :p, I was thinking about what to get you, something fun and maybe useful. And I got an idea! A bluetooth music player, but not just some random boring music player. It's a music player with a Tesla Coil!! I hope you have an amazing 2025! and don't electrocute yourself please!

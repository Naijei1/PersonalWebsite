        Hi Jules! Merry late Christmas and happy 2025! What a blast of a year it has been with both of us going on interesting adventures :p. One of the coolest things I thought you did this year was to have the chance to go see a real particle accelerator and do research! So, this got me thinking, what could I possibly get you to somehow top that. After a while of thinking, I came up with an idea! Although it may not be as cool as getting to a real particle accelerator, I thought it might be cool to have a mini one! So I got you a DIY Electromagnetic Marble Accelerator! I hope you have a great 2025!
